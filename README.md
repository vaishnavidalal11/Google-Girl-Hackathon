DiagnoAssist
============

Overview
--------

The **DiagnoAssist** is a web-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images, patient data, and symptoms. The application leverages **AI/ML models** for medical image analysis and symptom interpretation, providing accurate and efficient diagnostic suggestions.

Features
--------

1.  **Medical Image Analysis**:
    
    *   Upload and analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) using AI models.
        
    *   Detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, or pneumonia.
        
2.  **Symptom Interpretation**:
    
    *   Input patient symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.
        
    *   Uses NLP to interpret and correlate symptoms with known disease patterns.
        
3.  **Predictive Analytics**:
    
    *   Predict diseases based on patient data (e.g., age, gender, medical history).
        
4.  **User-Friendly Interface**:
    
    *   Intuitive frontend for healthcare professionals to input data and view results.
        

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Frontend**: React.js (Vite)
    
*   **Backend**: Flask (Python)
    
*   **AI/ML**: Medical image analysis (CNNs), symptom interpretation (NLP), and predictive analytics (ML algorithms) to provide accurate, efficient, and data-driven diagnostic suggestions for healthcare professionals. It leverages frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy for model training and deployment.
    
*   **Database**: SQLite (for local development)
    
*   **Deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku
    

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js** (for frontend)
    
*   **Python 3.8+** (for backend)
    
*   **pip** (Python package manager)
    
*   **Git** (for version control)
    

Setup Instructions
------------------

### 1\. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diagnostic-assistant.git
cd diagnostic-assistant
```

### 2\. Set Up the Backend

1.  Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\\Scripts\\activate
        ```  
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
4.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
5.  Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
    

### 3\. Set Up the Frontend

1.  Navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will start at http://localhost:5173.
   
    

Usage
-----

1.  **Upload Medical Images**:
    
    *   Use the "Upload Image" feature to analyze medical images.
        
    *   View diagnostic results with confidence scores.
        
2.  **Input Patient Data**:
    
    *   Enter patient details (e.g., age, gender, symptoms) in the form.
        
    *   Receive potential diagnoses based on the input.
        
3.  **View Results**:
    
    *   Diagnostic suggestions are displayed with confidence scores.
        
    *   Recommendations for further tests or treatments are provided.
        

Dataset
-------

The project uses the following datasets for training and testing AI models:

*   **CheXpert**: [CheXpert Dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)
    
*   **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**: [NIH Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data)
    
*   **MedMNIST**: [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/)
    

Deployment
----------

### Backend

1.  Deploy the Flask backend on **Heroku**:
    
    *   Install the Heroku CLI.
  
    *   Create a Procfile:
        ```bash
        web: python app.py
        ```
    *   Push your code to Heroku:
        ```bash
        heroku create
        git push heroku main
        ```
        

### Frontend

1.  Deploy the React frontend on **Netlify** or **Vercel**:
    
    *   Build the project:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
        
    *   Upload the dist folder to your chosen platform.
